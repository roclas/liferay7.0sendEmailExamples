# liferay7.0sendMailActivator
The simplest example of how to send an email programatically from Liferay

Sending an email from Liferay is very easy, this project is an example of how to do it:

The only things you need are:

* the right dependencies on your build.gradle file

* the code that actually sends the message (in my example, it is in Activator.java)


To test it, you can use FakeSMTP : http://nilhcem.com/FakeSMTP/
